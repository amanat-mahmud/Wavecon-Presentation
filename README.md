## ❓ Problem Statement
Wavecon, a telecommunications company in India, has recently launched its 5G network. The company needs to assess the impact of this launch on its market performance, revenue, and customer behavior. There are concerns about underperforming KPIs, the success of different plans, and the potential need to discontinue certain offerings. Wavecom requires a comprehensive analysis to understand the effects of the 5G launch and to make data-driven decisions for future strategy.

## 🎯 Objective
1. Evaluate the impact on overall revenue, active user base, and average revenue per user (ARPU).
2. Assess the performance of various plans, with a focus on identifying successful and underperforming offerings.
3. Analyze city-wise performance of various metric.
4. Investigate factors contributing to user churn.
5. Identify the drivers behind the KPI performance.
6. Examine the effectiveness of the 5G launch in maintaining market position and its influence on user behavior across different regions.
7. Provide data-driven recommendations for strategic decision-making to improve revenue, retain customers, and strengthen Wavecon's market position in the evolving 5G landscape.

## 🔎 Key Findings
- Total revenue  ₹31.9B with 0.50% drop after 5G launch.
- Number of active users also drop from 84.4M to 77.4M.
- Average revenue per user increased from ₹190.2 to ₹211.3.
- Only 2 of our plans increased in revenue. These both are long term data plans.
- Wavecon has maintained 3rd  market position.
- Number of unsubscribed user increased from 5.6M to 7M.
- Mumbai is top revenue generating city and also has most active user before and after launch of 5G.
- Before 5G Lucknow had the highest average revenue per user but after 5G Patna top the spot and Lucknow is not at 4th spot. But if we don’t consider 5G then Mumbai is at the top then Patna and then Lucknow.
- Mumbai had the most unsubscribed users before 5G but after 5G Delhi is at the top and Mumbai is on 3rd. But overall Mumbai has most unsubscribed users.



## 💡 Recommendations
- Focus on long-term data plans: Given that only long-term data plans showed increased revenue, consider developing and promoting more such plans. This could help stabilize revenue and retain customers.
- Investigate the reasons behind the significant drop in active users especially in Delhi and Mumbai where unsubscriptions are high.
- Despite the drop in total revenue and active users, the increase in average revenue per user is positive. Analyze the factors contributing to this increase and apply these insights across other segments and regions.
- Focus on improving 5G services and plans cities with high potential for revenue generation and ARPU growth.
- Study the factors that led to Cities rise to the top after 5G launch. Apply these learnings to other cities, especially which saw a significant drop in ranking.
- Conduct survey to find cause of increase of customer churn.
- Since non-5G ARPU rankings differ from overall rankings, there's room to improve 5G adoption and performance, particularly in high-potential cities like Mumbai and Lucknow.
- While maintaining the 3rd market position is positive, analyze competitors' strategies to identify opportunities for gaining market share.
- Evaluate plans that didn't see revenue increases and consider modifying or phasing them out in favor of more successful offerings.
- Use the city-specific insights to create tailored marketing campaigns and offers that address the unique needs and behaviors of users in different regions.
- Virat Kohli embodies performance, youth appeal, modernity, fitness, and consistency, with a wide fanbase, making him an ideal brand ambassador for Wavecon.
